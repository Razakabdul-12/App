Expensify Chat is an instant messaging system that helps you converse with people both inside and outside of your workspace about payments, company updates, and more. Expensify Chats are held in private chats, groups, and rooms.

- **Private chats** – Private conversations between you and one other person.
- **Groups** – Private conversations with two or more participants.
- **Rooms** – Public conversations are available to all members of your workspace.

## Managing existing chats

Manual creation of new chats and rooms is no longer available. Existing conversations remain accessible in your Inbox, and you can continue to collaborate within them:

- Open the conversation from the Inbox to review history and send new messages.
- Share the conversation link or ask a workspace admin to invite additional participants if needed.

If you need a new discussion space for a team, contact your workspace admin so they can create the appropriate chat or room on your behalf.

# FAQ

## Can I still start a brand-new chat?

No. New chats are created by workspace admins or when someone first messages you. Use your existing Inbox conversations or reach out to an admin if a new space is required.

## What happened to chat rooms?

Room creation is now restricted to workspace administrators. They can decide which rooms should exist and who should have access.
